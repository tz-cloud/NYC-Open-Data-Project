					<h3> OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION </h3>

					<hr>

					<img src="images/home/oti.jpg">

					<p class="text"> In recognition of the important role technology plays across all government services, Mayor Adams created the Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI) by signing Executive Order 3 in January 2022. This order combined the City's existing technology offices and marked an important shift in how the City of New York approaches technology and innovation. Instead of disparate offices operating in silos, OTI now represents a coordinated citywide approach under a single leader with a focused mission to deliver quality services to city residents. </p>
